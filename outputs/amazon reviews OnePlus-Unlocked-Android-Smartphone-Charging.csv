Not terrible but not great. Even for cheaper price.

Randomly will stop and restart sometimes even after doing a system update. Things will just stop working and even will randomly become unresponsive. Not a great device. I don't like getting a new phone every year since it should last me way more than that but I'm thinking about getting a new one already.

Mint 4G NOT Supported, and more.
","
Do not expect anything but burner phone, entry level, bare minimum, from this phone.Recommended as an emergency phone if yours breaks.  Even then I'd suggest a different 4G cheapo phone for guaranteed service. Reasons below.SCREEN:Acceptable 3 stars; it's not deep with colors, but the DPI is acceptable as average. Not 1080p either.It is a LCD screen. So not they can advertise HD, but its not spectacular. You can watch youtube on it but with this screen you won't tell the difference between 720 and 1080, save your data.BATTERY:Takes several hours to charge, (Shouldn't) doesn't quick charge.  My other phone would bump to 30-40% in 15min. And fully charge in 3hr, it had a 10000maH battery too!This one was 80% and must of been like 5 hours. And it only has a 3500mah to my knowledge.  So twice the time to charge half the battery size. !?SERVICE: Terrible!Mint 4G not supported. I only get T-mobile 5G, which is spotty and poor in my area, hours with tech support and settings. Finally they told me.So even with Wi-Fi calling enabled (Which is marketing term for ROAMING DATA) purposefully worded to confuse you with ROAMING terms,Even with 5G, I cannot get MMS or anything Digital (Such as hotspot or browser) unless I'm literally connected to an Xfinity or Commercial Wi-Fi like Starbucks.  Even then; they block most stuff.So now I have to have Offline Maps, Downloaded music and that effort, I cannot get MMS when on the road, and other issues. Like immediate uploading of pictures to Cloud and more I didn't realize.NOTE: on 4G vs 5G;  you will NOT know the difference unless streaming 4k netflix or something on hotspot. There is NO benefit to 5G outside of daily usage. 4G speeds more then suffice even for things like uploading 100MB videos.IF you get a strong 5G signal, AND IF the technical requirements all align, the difference is like 1 minute per 300 megs.Example - If you use 'this' phone as hotspot in an RV or you are a Live Streamer. (as the benefits listed are for using this phone and not the service itself).Otherwise 5G is just marketing. Either way if 5G is your thing you probably want Tesla Satellite, and a better phone capable of the Processing needed for that stuff.In Short; this phone was created to market 5G at entry level. It is NOT capable of processing heavy data services you would see a benefit from while using 5G.  (If you actually got pure 5G as advertised)AUDIO:  Sounds great.BLUETOOTH: Works Great. Sounds noticeably better then my last phone. easy when I connect.  I had some delay and trouble connecting to my Android car stereo but after that no issues. it wasn't doing A2DP but for some reason it sounds great on my Headphones.BLOATWARE:  Yes; comes with unremovable One+ software, AND asks you to log into their cloud, AND Asks you to accept them selling your info on setup. (you can decline) but there are OTHER Hidden places and tricky popups to trick you into accepting. such as in the settings menu.  It will also show red radio buttons as if there's and issue, when in fact its just a trick to get you to sign up to their cloud or accept their marketing terms.MENU SYSTEM: Proprietary. But acts for the most part as standard. You won't have trouble finding settings.PROCESSOR SPEED:  Standard Performance, not slow, make sure you have android 11 and update.  I can run maps, and Pandora no problem. that's all I tested.

Love and hate it!  Major notificaion problem!
","
I've had it a little over a year now.  I'm going to go into description of only the problems.  For about the first 4 months, pocket mode was horrible until a update fixed it.  That's the only update it's ever had.  I was able to disable it until the update.  I'm actually not sure if the feature still exists after checking that the update re-enabled it.Case selection is very few.  The case I bought and screen protector is way too tight of a fit.  about .020"" if it had it centered properly but that's almost impossible to do.  Fingerprint reader is hit or miss.  Sometimes it won't read my thumb, few times it's opened for my thumb nail or other fingers.The camera is strange.  You see it in the viewer and then you look at the picture you took and it's different colors and not grainy.  USB C file transfer is horribly slow.  Like dialup speeds.  It's faster for my to transfer my files from my phone to my micro sd and then take the micro sd card out and plug that into my computer.The thing that is making me want to throw away this phone is the notifications.  When I first go it, every single app was spamming the heck out of the phone and it took forever to disable them all as it had to be done as they popped up for some reason.  Maybe that was how it worked at the time or I just didn't find the menu for it at the time.At some point early on I noticed that my notifications were delayed.  Sometimes over a hour delayed.  To this day my phone will start beeping off several times when it gets a influx of notifications.  Anywhere from 5 minutes to a hour late.I've spent hours googling this problem only to see the same answers over and over and none of them fixed it.  Same with Facebook Messenger which is very important to me.  Literally 90% of the time it will not give me a notification.  I have to constantly check it.  Today I even noticed I didn't get a notification for a txt message which is very unusual.  Sometimes all is good but very often this happens.A annoying thing is that there are Android apps and Nord Apps.  I have no idea to this day which one I should use and why.Updating apps on Android is pretty bad.  The app store is as bad as Apple's.Pros:Cheaplarge storagemicro sd slot for more storage3.5mm jackusb c fast chargebattery last 2 days of streaming youtube music videos 8hrs a day over bluetooth and then some.Cons:Notifications!!!File transfer over USB-C at dialup speeds!!!Finger readerCase selectionInconsistently slowCamera ViewerApp UpdatesApp store

Great, unless you want to use it for phone calls
","
The phone is fine except it can't be used for phone calls over WiFi (which is typically how most phone calls work these days.) The other person can hear us but we can't hear the other person or voicemail.WiFi calling can be turned off of course, but we don't get a signal in my area unless I'm upstairs.Turns out this has been a problem with OnePlus phones for years and they haven't acknowledged or fixed the problem. Search ""OnePlus can't hear caller"".We got it for my 12 yo for basic emergency use so we didn't realize how pervasive the problem was until past the return window. It does work right after reboot, but evidently not for very long.  The last 2 weeks every call we've made my son has had to reboot and then call us back. OnePlus has robbed us of $200. I'd request a new one but it'll have the same problem.Btw, the location of the fingerprint reader on the power button itself is incredibly awkward.

Nothing But Trouble
","
I have had nothing but trouble with this phone.  I've had it since December 2022 and continue to have issues.  T-mobile has worked with me several times, to ensure it is not on their end.  I've gotten 2 different sim cards because it seemed like the carrier was the problem.  We have reset the phone and I still have trouble hearing the person on the other end.  They can hear me, but I can't hear them.  I've gotten new earbuds, thinking maybe that was the issue.  It doesn't matter whether I am at home or on the road, actually using this as a phone is a big issue.  Everyone tells me it is the phone and I have exhausted all other options to get it to work correctly.

Stupid POS phone
","
I don’t know which model is which but I’m pretty sure they all suck pretty bad all the same. This is the worst phone I’ve owned ever in my life. I’m pissed off that I’ve had to own this phone for the last year. I’m never going to buy a Nord phone ever again, there’s so many things that I hate about this phone that there’s too much to write. if you’re a casual phone user maybe using your phone maybe five minutes a day like an 80 year old person. This phone might be OK for you other than that I wouldn’t recommend it for anyone . I added a photo to show which model I own. Nord needs to stop making phones or make them at least decent before releasing these POS to the public. And I’m also pissed off at Metro pcs for selling me this phone in their store.

This is probably the worst phone I ever owned. Took advantage of the latest  iphone credit for my better half and daughter. I skimped on my phone with this one. It can't load much for any type of multitasking. It drops Bluetooth or simply won't connect. It's choppy and the video flakes out on videos and games. I often have to restart it to clear the memory. Sometimes it will get frozen and it takes a couple of minutes for it it start working. Most of the time I end up restarting. My iphone 6 plus out preforms this. If it were not for a dying battery I stick with my old phone.

I always enter recovery when I get a phone to validate the device. I discovered that if you press the volume buttons and power when off, it completely kills the phone. I assumed this could be a hardware fault. I tried every combination of button press. Nothing worked. I tried a tablet charger that hadn't been used in a while without plugging it into a power source. I plugged it into the phone. Magically the phone came up. However if I repressed the buttons the phone instantly and unceremoniously would turn off. I waited with the phone plugged into another long dead charger. The phone then worked normally. I decided to repeat to validate. It happened again. I can't believe this made it to production. I should probably return this phone...

You pay for what you get. Horrible, slow, Buggy, 4G LTE phone, not 5G!
","
Don't look at this phone for a camera, it's horrible with incorrect color balance and focus.It is a kin to an old desktop webcam circa 2005.Also, the bugs in it are frustrating. Constant freezes and app crashing.Its slow as hell and NOT 5G! It is a 4g LTE.The audio is basic and nothing to jam with and audio output sound best with an EQ.Its a basic emergency phone you would have as a backup in emergencies and nothing else.

Camera Issues and Fingerprint Sensor Glitches
","
The phone looks nice and is fast BUT the camera app wouldn't open and then only would open and close. I went online and noticed that was a big issue for this One Plus model phone! It seems like it's not very fixable if you have to keep restarting your phone just to get your camera to work.  The finger sensor was very messed up! It took me a while just to set up my finger print security scan! I can see why this phone has never been popular in the US. Too many nagging issues right out of the box. The phone looks premium but isn't for anyone with little patience. I'm going back to Samsung!

Decent phone, but there are a couple of things that bother me. The Clear All button doesn't work, says  it's Optimized and since there are only screen function buttons only, you should be able to pin the buttons to the bottom of the screen. You have to swipe up to get them and of course the apps have an ad there

Not worth $239.99
","
I bought this phone 1.5 years ago and it is slow AF now, apps take 2-3 minutes to open. Answering calls takes 30 seconds to recognize my tap on a good day.However, the issues began on day 1. Playing videos sometimes caused the screen to crap itself and jitter as if it was having a stroke. I pushed through that. Then noticed calls dropping like no other phone I have ever had. 6 months in I realized the ""5G"" capability was the biggest load of BS as any time the 5G setting was on the phone would intermittently lose internet/network connection. This is more common if you drive anywhere (even in major cities) because the phone keeps trying to reconnect. This bug makes GPS navigation completely useless as the phone keeps forgetting where it is throughout the drive. These are just some of the issues... and I am already over this review because this phone is crap...Please don't buy One Plus phones (maybe the flagship is better, but I will NEVER recommend spending more money on this company if this is what they put out at cheaper ranges). I cannot believe I bought this crap instead of a Motorola.Will never purchase a OnePlus phone again.

I had a moto g5 stylus before it broke which wasn't a huge step up from this but it's in the same price range so I'd go with that one.... The camera and speed is worst on this one but overall it's an okay back up phone. It may even be an okay main phone if you don't use your phone a lot.

Nice and slim like I prefer. Good price. I hate thick bulky phone cases when I have to constantly keep my phone handy for work. Mostly only use it for scratch protection and to add grippiness to today's sleek slippery phones.Problem is the material yellowed pretty bad very quickly with it looking like it was ancient after a year and not only where my hands rest. Functionally it's still fine but looks terrible.

This is the worst phone I've ever owned.
","
I bought this phone in July 2022 - 5 months ago. My first issue with this phone was realizing that to send a picture to more than one person I have to download the picture, save it, move it to internal storage. THEN I have to select all the people it's going to, then attach the picture. If someone else has figured out an easier way I'd love to hear it. Whenever I tried anything different, the picture would disappear when I added a second person. If that was the only thing I have to deal with I'd be ok. Now after 5 months, it randomly drops calls. I know the problem is with my phone because when I call my party back from a landline or any other phone, there's no problem. The camera is terrible, pics are usually blurry unless I'm standing pretty close and it doesn't matter what zoom I use. I also tested this theory with other cameras, thinking I might be a little shaky and causing the pic to blur. Nope, they come out clear with any other phone I use. Lately, my phone has been ""blacking out"". By this I mean the screen goes black - not the fade out when it's been idle, but black while fully charged. And it locks itself. I can't power it off, if I dial my number from another phone it goes straight to voicemail. The first time I had to wait it out, that took about 3 minutes. The second time I had to utilize ""Find My Phone"" to unlock it. I don't like to do negative reviews, unfortunately in this instance I feel I had no choice. I called customer service today, when I selected 1 for English I got a fast busy signal - that only adds to my regret to having purchased this phone.

You get what you pay for

I purchased this phone from a T-Mobile store. It does not respond well to touch. Unlocking it at times requires you to press very hard with your thumb and swipe up. It can also be frustrating to answer or reject a call.You do not have the option to send a text message from your Contact list. You can only place calls. You cannot send a message from your Message list unless a thread has already been established by someone sending you a message first. I even looked up how to send a message in the user manual. The instructions were wrong.Even more ridiculous is that when you go into Edit mode to change the phone number of a contact, you get a message saying the new number is invalid, though it isn't. You must delete the current contact and create a new one from scratch.This phone has the worst user interface of any product I've ever used.

After having the phone for only a couple of months, it dropped all the data, contacts and messages. This happened TWO MORE times, along with the irregularities whenever ""updates"" occurred. OnePlus' solution: borrow a phone and return this one for repair.It's a poorly-engineered piece of junk with dismal customer support. I told the representative of my intention to leave a seriously negative review wherever possible if the could not come up with a better solution. Finding new clients is much more difficult than appeasing current ones. They don't get it.

Overall the phone is fine - not as comfortable as a samsung. But remove stars for review due to the charging port. Whatever usb cord I use, the connection to the charging port on the phone is VERY flimsy.When you plug in the cord to the phone, the connection does not click securely or hold well. VERY VERY BAD as the charging cords can somehow detach itself from the charging port due to it fitting so loosely.If you have another option than this, pick the OTHER option. If you don't have another option, find another choice of phone fast.

I got this as a temp replacement when my pixel bricked itself updating. I figured yeah it's a little cheaper but whatever how bad could it be? BAD. The fast charging feature is either a fake selling point or I got a dud. Even brand new it took all night to fully charge, I now have to have it plugged in pretty much everywhere I go, or it'll die. It's only about 7 months old. Having 5G doesn't really count for much when the phone itself is slow. VERY slow, takes about a second or two to respond when opening apps or going thru different screens, frequently ending up clicking things you didn't want too because it took so long to load. The cameras might be a decent mp number but it doesn't look like it, always a little blurry and washed out. Overall this phone works as if it was made and released ten years ago. I'd never recommend it.
